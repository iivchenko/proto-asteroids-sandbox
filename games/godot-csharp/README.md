* You don't need to install engine it self,  just download binaries
* The metdata files siple/easy to read/modify

Negatives:
* You have to install export sdks locally for each engine version
* C# code editor in Godot IDE bad: not intelicense, default scripts are bad etc.
* Some of runtime exeptions doesn't fail the game (e.g. when can't set body disabled true)
