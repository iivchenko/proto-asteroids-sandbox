# Game Maker Studio (GML)

Positives:
* The code first or code main approach
* Quite strict and logical entities hierarchy
* Scripts directly existing with or inside objects
* Possibility to create independent scripts/systems or objects

Negatives:
* Missing UI editor
* Rooms has only creation scrips but no other events or other scripting
* Generates lots of metadata folders/files for assets
* In order to use font it must be installed in the OS
* Don't feel comfortable working with frames directly, I wish I have seconds
* The Json as always is not readable
* GML dynamic typing
* Constantly GPU is exhausted when GMS running
* UI of the engine when zooming up/down start to be blury
* Particle system is not that rich
* The dynamic nature of Layers that are represented as string in scripts
* Notes just dummy txt file - I create such my self in any engine
